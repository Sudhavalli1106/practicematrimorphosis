Read me file:
This is a demo repo created to practice certain basic commands. I am logging certain commands here.
a) First sign in to git hub account
b) click on "new" to crete a new repo
c) you can optionally add readme file automatically or after creating new repo you can manually create readme file. - its a markdown file
  the purpose of readme is to create general information that is relevant to the project. say name of the project, short description, some important initial info ,etc
d) once you finish typing click on commit changes button
e) after commit you can see the readme file along with commit msg. in case you need to edit or view, click on that readme.md link and you can view then click on pencil icon to edit. after editing click on commit changes and give commit text so that we track the history of changes and its reason. this stands the same for all kind of files that you upload
